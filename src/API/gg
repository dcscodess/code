idea generation :
Theme : Agritech, Edutech, Smart Manufacture, Suppy chain


Mind Mapping : 
1. identify the core problem : 
2. branch out into key areas : users, environment, constraints
3. Expand each brnaches : potential variation to the idea
4. Refine and connect the ideas : to identify the 



SCAMPER method : transforming the existing solutions
Substitute : replacement unique component with a btter approach
Combine : merging two ideas for a stronger impact
Adapt : to modify an existing sln to fit to a new problem
Modify : Can we change the shape, functions, or th process to improve the efficiency
put to another use: reppurpose an existing cncept f for a differnt industry or domain.
Elimate :removing the unneccesary components ?
Reverse : rethink the entire process in a different order


Rapid Ideation : generating ideas at scale 

Speed , Volume

Setting up the timer
No filtering
group similar ideas

Example : How can AI Rvolutionize education ?

AI powerd personalized learning paths 
Gamify : Super coins, e-gadgets, goodies
Ai generated real time feedback onassignments




Design Thinking : Human centered approach
problem solving methodology that focuses on understanding user needs and developing empatheic solutions

5 stages :
Empathize : understand user's needs
Define : defining the problem area clearly
Ideate : generate a diverse approaches
Prototype , PoC : low-fidelity models to test feasibility
Test : gather the feedback and refine the solutions
